This is a revision of the code from here:

Which was written by James Lissiak https://github.com/BlankSourceCode

I had trouble using that script in OBS Studio on my Mac M4 Pro running Sequoia 15.1.

The zoom was not centering on the mouse correctly.
Additionally, I dislike that moving the zoom window requires moving the mouse to the edges of that zoom box.
I prefer if the zoom is always centered on the mouse and moves with it in realtime.
So I made some changes to the script (well, o3-mini-high did most of the work).

This script works great for me now. Follow the same installation instructions as the original script.
Or if you need a tutorial video, it's the same as the instructions here:

Cool. Good luck.
